# Security-Operations-Center
# SOC Analyst Overview

 Introduction
This repository provides insights into the fundamentals of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and their critical role in modern cybersecurity. It includes an overview of SOC operations, tiered roles, key cybersecurity principles like the CIA Triad, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework for analyzing attack vectors.

  Contents

1. Introduction to SOC and Cybersecurity
   - Definition and objectives of a SOC.
   - Comparison between SOC and NOC (Network Operations Center).
   - Importance of SOC in organizations today.

2. SOC Operations and Roles
   - Detailed analysis of Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 roles in SOC.
   - Skills required and responsibilities at each tier.

3.  Cybersecurity Concepts
   - Explanation of the CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
   - Application of these principles in SOC operations.

4.  MITRE ATT&CK Framework
   - Overview of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - Real-world examples of attack vectors such as phishing, credential dumping, and ransomware.

5.  Key Findings and Recommendations
   - Analysis of SOC challenges and trends.
   - Practical recommendations for SOC professionals and organizations.
